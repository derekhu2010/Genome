# Genome
CS 32 Project
I implemented a genome class (implementation found in Genome.cpp) that was capable of loading genome data from txt files and storing it in a genome object. Implemented a Genome Matcher class (implementation in GenomeMatcher.cpp) that was capable of maintaining a library of genomes, searching genomes for matching DNA subsequences and SNP's (single nucleotide polymorphisms), and finding genomes that contain above a user-inputted percentage of matching DNA.
