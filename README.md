# Genome
CS 32 Project
I implemented a genome class (implementation found in Genome.cpp) that was capable of loading genome data from txt files and storing it in a genome object. Implemented a Genome Matcher class (implementation in GenomeMatcher.cpp) that was capable of maintaining a library of genomes and using a Trie data structure to search for matching DNA sequences, search for single nucleotide polymorphisms, and determine the percentage of match between genomes.
