# Genome
CS 32 Project
I implemented a genome class (implementation found in Genome.cpp) that was capable of loading genome data from txt files and storing it in a genome object. Implemented a Genome Matcher class (implementation in GenomeMatcher.cpp) that was capable of maintaining a library of genomes and using a Trie data structure to search for matching DNA sequences, search for single nucleotide polymorphisms, and determine the percentage of match between genomes.

This was a CS 32 class project. Some class interfaces were provided by the professor, and students were responsible for implementing those functions. If you are currently enrolled in CS 32, copying code will result in violation of the academic integrity policies of the course. More detailed desciption of classes and functions in the project spec file.
